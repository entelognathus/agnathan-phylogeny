> - Chen *et al*. (2022) used the term 'central canal' to describe a short canal issued from the middle of the dorsal commissure. As the 'central sensory canal' is conventionally used to represent the canal leaving from the infraorbital canal in placoderms, we replace the 'central canal' in galeaspids with the 'medial canal' to avoid confusion (Chen et al., in prep.).

> Chen *et al*. (in prep.), Character 68.

> - This is a character added by Chen et al. (in prep.). This character defines the shared state in the 'eugaleaspid cluster'. In *Yongdongaspis* and *Sinogaleaspis*, the connection between two canals forms a twisted line.
