# Character list of aganthans and comments

From the original dataset of Miyashita *et al*. (2019), two characters (#44, #81) are excluded and one new character (#144) is added in Miyashita *et al*. (2021).

From Miyashita *et al*. (2021) to Dearden *et al*. (2023), Arandaspida and Heterostraci are removed;  *Anglaspis*, *Eriptychius*, *Errivaspis*, *Sacabambaspis* are added; *Astraspis* and *Athenaegis* are modified.

> - Dearden *et al*. (2023): “In previous versions of this matrix *Sacabambaspis* was scored 1 based on a heterostracan-like  anatomical interpretation (see discussion in supplement of Miyashita et al. 2019). However, as discussed in the main text, the incoherency of pteraspidomorphs and the dissimilarity of the placement of the orbits in *Sacabambaspis* compared to *Eriptychius*, *Astraspis*, and  heterostracans leaves open the possibility that the orbital position in *Sacabambaspis* reflects a weakly developed prechordal head rather than being derived from a heterostracan-like form. Thus we score *Sacabambaspis* 0 which we believe to be more consistent with the observed state in the fossils. We note though that either of these interpretations are plausible until more is known about the internal anatomy of arandaspids.”

6. Profundal nerve ganglion: 0, separate from trigeminal ganglion; 1, fused with trigeminal ganglion.

> - Miyashita *et al*. (2019): "In the galeaspid Shuyu, the roots for V1+0 and V2+3 are well separated (152) so the ganglia were likely independent as well. In osteostracans, these nerves share a narrow root under the myodome of the orbital cavity (153, 154) so the ganglia were likely fused. One conspicuous example is seen in Belonaspis (MNHN SVD 1005). It is difficult to assess this character in arthrodires, but the size and shape of the trigeminal canal are comparable to those in 
chondrichthyans (155–159), and they are tentatively coded as separated. This character is contingent on having a vertebrate brain and cranial nerves (#4, this analysis)."

> - Miyashita *et al*. (2019): "The original definition in the CMC dataset concerned the presence of pretrematic branch in branchial nerves, where jawless vertebrates were coded as lacking the branch. Cyclostomes clearly have pretrematic branch in the glossopharyngeal and vagus nerves (160). The facial nerve, however, lacks the bipartite organization of pre- and post-trematic branches being separated by the hyomandibular pouch (29, 161). What appears to correspond to a pretrematic branch is a split of the postrematic branch. The lack of the pretrematic branch in the facial nerve is also consistent with the lack of pseudobranch (gill-like folded epithelium in hyomandibular position) in cyclostomes, suggesting that the structure represents a derived state acquired in the stem of gnathostomes (115)."

> - Miyashita *et al*. (2019): "This character supplements character #9 (ventral and dorsal roots united). Indeed, hagfish and gnathostomes are similar to each other for having the dorsal and ventral roots united (they are separate in lampreys). However, both roots originate at the intra-segmental level (medial to myomeres) in lampreys and gnathostomes, whereas the origin is at the inter-segmental level (medial to myosepta) in hagfish (162). To capture the full range of this variation, this addition to CMC #10 is required."

snout (39, 164–166) — or, as superficially interpreted, the distance between the mouth and the 
nostril. If the pertinent structures in Haikouichthys (163) and Metaspriggina (35) are correlates 
of the nasohypophyseal system, the openings would have been terminal, not dorsal. This 
character is inapplicable to those without adenohypophysis or olfactory capsules (#14 and 16, 
this analysis). Myxinikela is coded for the plesiomorphic state (0, terminal). As done for other 
controversial taxa and characters throughout this analysis, this was verified independently by 
multiple authors on the original material that preserves the snout."

> - Miyashita *et al*. (2019): "Galeaspids are coded as unknown (‘?’) for this character. The existing reconstruction of their 
internal anatomy (152) does not indicate whether or not the nasal cavity was open to the 
oropharyngeal cavity. The hypophyseal canal opened into the oral cavity, but that system is 
separate from the nasal passage in this lineage (152), like in crown-group gnathostomes.
Palaeospondylus is coded as having a blind nasohypophyseal canal, both under the 
cyclostome and gnathostome models. The cyclostome model posits a basket of longitudinal bars 
at the anterior end of the skull as the olfactory capsule (95). If true, the olfactory cavity would 
be closed posteriorly by contact between this element and the neurocranium, or else the 
nasohypophyseal canal would have to extend below the commissure — unlike any known cyclostomes. Thus, the canal of Palaeospondylus was coded as blind, consistent with a 
cyclostome interpretation. The character is contingent on the presence of the 
nasohypophyseal/nasal cavity (#14 and #16, this analysis)."

> - Miyashita *et al*. (2019): "This character likely correlates with the organization of nasal (olfactory) capsules (#20, this 
analysis). On the basis of paired capsules with a single aperture in stem gnathostomes and 
possibly in myllokunmingiids, the primitive state (single) does not assume a particular state in 
character #20. However, there is no example of paired apertures with a single capsule, 
suggesting that the derived state (paired) in this character is contingent on the derived state of 
character #20. One way to treat this likely contingency is to code only those with the derived 
state of character #20. However, multiple stem gnathostomes (anaspids, arandaspids, 
thelodonts, Jamoytius, Athenaegis, etc.) are preserved with no imprints of the capsules and 
therefore can only be scored for the organization of the aperture. Some of them are also highly 
incomplete with a limited number of characters scored. To compare them with the maximum 
range of OTUs, this character is coded without contingency on character #20."

> - Dearden *et al*. (2023): “Miyashita et al. (2019, 2021) coded this character on the basis of the number of olfactory openings. Based on Gagnier’s (1993) interpretation *Sacabambaspis* had two openings; we have coded it as 
paired. Heterostracan taxa are coded ?: the anatomy nasohypophyseal openings has never been conclusively shown."

scope of this paper, here *Eriptychius*, *Sacabambaspis*, *Astraspis* and heterostracan taxa are assumed to have uncovered eyes and we have scored them absent in keeping with the scoring approach of Miyashita et al. (2019, 2021).

> - Miyashita *et al*. (2019): "The character is contingent on the presence of eyes (#26, this analysis). Euconodonts are 
typically coded as having extraocular muscles on the basis of the fibrous soft tissues preserved 
in the Carboniferous euconodont Promissum (172). This observation constitutes one of the 
prominent inferences for the vertebrate affinity of conodonts, but also has attracted controversy
(27). Certainly, the extraocular muscles are a collection of individual bundles of muscles, whereas the supposed structure in Promissum shows no such organization. Two lines of 
evidence consistent with the original interpretation are the position close to the posited eye and 
the fibrous texture unlike typical cartilages (172). Alternatively, the tissues may be preserved in 
a more advanced stage of decay than assumed originally (22). In that case, it would be difficult 
to identify the tissue as anything more specific than remnants of cranial musculature.
Another possible interpretation is that the ‘extraocular muscles’ of Promissum represent 
a patch of mucocartilage-like supporting tissue. Mucocartilages in modern larval lampreys
(173–177) appear morphologically similar and compatible in anatomical position with the 
‘muscles’ of Promissum. All of these interpretations are compatible with the currently available 
evidence, and none can be readily ruled out. To highlight uncertain identity of the preserved 
tissues, euconodonts were scored as unknown (‘?’) for this character."

29. Muscles innervated by oculomotor nerve: 0, three; 1, four.
> Miyashita *et al*. (2019), Character 29; Miyashita *et al*. (2021), Character 29; Dearden *et al*. (2023), Character 29.

> - Miyashita *et al*. (2019): "The following characters describe three major character transitions in the extraocular muscles 
before the chondrichthyan-osteichthyan divergence. The oculomotor nerve innervates three 
muscles in lampreys (dorsal ramus: superior rectus; ventral ramus: anterior oblique, internal 
rectus) and four in gnathostomes (dorsal ramus: superior rectus; ventral ramus: inferior oblique, 
inferior rectus; internal rectus [dorsal ramus in chondrichthyans; ventral ramus in 
osteichthyans]) (178). Osteostracans were coded as unknown (‘?’) for this character, because 
only two muscle attachments exist for the muscles of the oculomotor nerve and because neither 
provides direct evidence for multiple elements attached as in other vertebrate lineages (179). 
This character explicitly refers only to the numbers of elements so as not to assume any one of 
multiple possible schemes of homology among these muscles a priori. A reference to number
of elements (and not to interpretations of homology for the individual components) allows 
placoderms to be scored for this character.
Depending on the identification schemes, additional characters may be formulated to resolve ingroup relationships among gnathostomes, but this is beyond the schope of this 
analysis. In a brief summary, correspondence with the counterparts in crown gnathostomes is 
unclear for the four muscles innervated by the oculomotor nerve in placoderms. The anterior 
oblique (corresponding to inferior oblique in crown gnathostomes) is undisputed. The rectus 
inserting dorsally appears to correspond superior rectus topographically and probably received 
innervation from the dorsal ramus, but has been identified as internal rectus on the basis of its 
insertion dorsally to the anterior oblique (178). Problematically, identification of this muscle as 
internal rectus assumes either: (a) the superior rectus was lost and one additional muscle added 
in placoderms; or (b) the superior rectus independently evolved in lampreys and gnathostomes. 
Transposition of the extraocular muscles is necessary no matter which assignment is followed 
— the internal rectus passes below the anterior oblique in lampreys, whereas it typically inserts 
dorsal to the inferior oblique in crown gnathostomes. Therefore, it appears most parsimonious 
to recognize the four muscles in placoderms as homologous to those of crown gnathostomes 
(anterior oblique [inferior oblique], internal rectus, inferior rectus, and superior rectus; the last 
probably being the only muscle innervated by the dorsal ramus). This character is contingent on

homology of the second muscle to the posterior rectus remains unresolved (178). In osteostracans, a single myodome sits in the corresponding position, and it remains unclear

> - Miyashita *et al*. (2019): "The original definition (otic capsules, absent or present) is modified to predict distribution of 
the character in the stem branches with respect to general decay sequences. The otic capsules 
are among the most resistant skeletal structures to decay (1, 2, 78, 109). Therefore, the absence 
of the structure may be inferred in specimens preserved with an extensive set of soft tissues that 
would have otherwise decayed well before the otic capsules, from the localities where cartilages 
and other soft tissues are readily preserved. These conditions rule out the Lesmahagow and 
Achanarras forms (Achanarella, Ciderius, Cornovichthys, Jamoytius) and the Miguasha forms 
(Euphanerops: most cartilages preserved in this taxon are calcified) (77, 180) from 
consideration — unless the structure is clearly present in fossils (e.g., Lasanius: MNHN 
specimens under study) (181). These leave several taxa from the Mazon Creek fauna and from 
the Chengjiang and Burgess/Marble Canyon fauna (35, 94, 117, 163, 182, 183). Among them, 
the identification of an otic capsule in Haikouichthys (182) is accepted, whereas the 
corresponding region is not well represented in Myllokunmingia. For all others, the capsule is 
coded as absent. This does not rule out the presence of otic placodes or capsules in those taxa (Haikouella, Pikaia, and Metaspriggina), but if present, they are unlikely to have been 
extensively chondrified."

> - Dearden *et al*. (2023): “Cartilaginous otic capsules are not preserved in *Eriptychius* PF 1795. However, it is unclear whether they were present in life as they could have either been unmineralized and thus not fossilised, or alternatively lost prior due to disruption to the carcass during fossilisation.

> - Miyashita *et al*. (2019): "Although the single semicircular canal in hagfish is often described as a ‘horizontal’ canal, a 
series of stem gnathostome lineages (heterostracans, galeaspids, and osteostracans) clearly 
indicates that the horizontal canal is unique to jawed gnathostomes. So the anterior and 
posterior canals have broader distributions, and the condition in lampreys is compatible with 
that assignment. Given that hagfish have the two cristae in positions corresponding to the 
anterior and posterior canals in lampreys (184), the ‘horizontal’ canal of hagfish is the fusion of 
the anterior and posterior canals partway in their loops. Its state is best interpreted as the loss of 
the confluent part of the anterior and posterior loops. This character is contingent on the 
presence of an otic capsule (#33, this analysis)."

chordates and hemichordates, as the function is replaced by the unique epidermal structure 
Schreiner organs (innervated by the non-gustatory trigeminal nerve; not requiring purinergic 
signaling) (130, 131). This is a specialization unique to hagfish and reported in multiple extant 
species. The implication is that internal taste buds and Schreiner organs are mutually exclusive, 
so these are treated as separate states in a single character. Alternatively, this character may be 
coded in two characters: (a) end chemosensory organs innervated by cranial nerves in head: 0, 
absent; 1, present; and contingent on the presence, (b) end chemosensory organs: 0, internal 
taste buds; 1, Schreiner organs. However, the character (a) will be constant because the

This character now describes a position of the pharyngeal arch derivatives with respect to the nervous system, where the otic capsule and roots of all cranial nerves retain their relative positions to each other. The otic capsule is 
intended as a landmark — so this character may be assessed by using the overall configuration of structures spatially correlated with the otic capsule (with respect to the eye, the most anterior myomeres, the notochord, and others) when the otic capsule is not preserved. This strategy is sensible only for those that are unambiguously preserved with these alternative landmark structures (e.g., Euphanerops) (77). Therefore, this character is inapplicable to taxa in which (a) it is uncertain whether the otic capsule was absent or not preserved; and (b) other landmark structures are not comparable or not preserved (e.g., euconodonts and Haikouella)."

(2019): "Although the adorbital opening has been interpreted as spiracular in amphiaspidiform heterostracans and pituriaspids (115, 186, 187), this character is conservatively coded as unknown in both taxa. Beyond its position beside the orbit and otic capsule, little evidence exists for the hyomandibular identity of this opening. An alternative interpretation for this opening is a nasohypophyseal aperture (149). The amphiaspidiform condition is likely an independent derivation within heterostracans (88, 115) because this clade is nested within the Heterostraci (188–192), and because the general condition among heterostracans is blind (0) for 
this character. Modifying the scores for heterostracans (0/1) and pituriaspids (1) did not affect the topology presented in Fig. S6."
