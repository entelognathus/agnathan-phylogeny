**Character list of aganthans and comments**

From the original dataset of Miyashita *et al*. (2019), two characters (#44, #81) are excluded and one new character (#144) is added in Miyashita *et al*. (2021).

From Miyashita *et al*. (2021) to Dearden *et al*. (2023), Arandaspida and Heterostraci are removed;  *Anglaspis*, *Eriptychius*, *Errivaspis*, *Sacabambaspis* are added; *Astraspis* and *Athenaegis* are modified.

1. Skeletal derivatives of neural crest: 0, absent; 1, present.
> Miyashita *et al*. (2019), Character 1; Miyashita *et al*. (2021), Character 1; Dearden *et al*. (2023), Character 1.

2. Ectodermal placodes: 0, absent; 1, present.
> Miyashita *et al*. (2019), Character 2; Miyashita *et al*. (2021), Character 2; Dearden *et al*. (2023), Character 2.

3. Distinct prechordal head: 0, absent or weakly developed; 1, prominent.
> Miyashita *et al*. (2019), Character 3; Miyashita *et al*. (2021), Character 3; Dearden *et al*. (2023), Character 3.
>
> - Dearden *et al*. (2023): “In previous versions of this matrix *Sacabambaspis* was scored 1 based on a heterostracan-like  anatomical interpretation (see discussion in supplement of Miyashita et al. 2019). However, 
as discussed in the main text, the incoherency of pteraspidomorphs and the dissimilarity of the placement of the orbits in *Sacabambaspis* compared to *Eriptychius*, *Astraspis*, and  heterostracans leaves open the possibility that the orbital position in *Sacabambaspis* reflects a weakly developed prechordal head rather than being derived from a heterostracan-like form. Thus we score *Sacabambaspis* 0 which we believe to be more consistent with the observed state in the fossils. We note though that either of these interpretations are plausible until more is known about the internal anatomy of arandaspids.”

4. Tripartite vesicles at anterior end of neural tube (prosencephalon, mesencephalon, rhombencephalon): 0, absent; 1, present.
> Miyashita *et al*. (2019), Character 4; Miyashita *et al*. (2021), Character 4; Dearden *et al*. (2023), Character 4.

5. Morphologically distinct cerebellum with corpus cerebelli: 0, absent; 1, present.
> Miyashita *et al*. (2019), Character 5; Miyashita *et al*. (2021), Character 5; Dearden *et al*. (2023), Character 5.

> - Dearden *et al*. (2023): “Following Miyashita et al. (2019, 2021) scoring for heterostracans *Anglaspis* has been scored 1, but note it has been disputed whether this constitutes the cerebellum (summarised in Janvier 1996, pg. 273)."

6. Profundal nerve ganglion: 0, separate from trigeminal ganglion; 1, fused with trigeminal ganglion.
> Miyashita *et al*. (2019), Character 6; Miyashita *et al*. (2021), Character 6; Dearden *et al*. (2023), Character 6.

7. Tripartite division of facial nerve into pharyngeal, 'pretrematic', and 'postrematic' branches: 0, absent; 1, present.
> Miyashita *et al*. (2019), Character 7; Miyashita *et al*. (2021), Character 7; Dearden *et al*. (2023), Character 7.

8. Spinal cord in cross section: 0, round; 1, flattened.
> Miyashita *et al*. (2019), Character 8; Miyashita *et al*. (2021), Character 8; Dearden *et al*. (2023), Character 8.

9. Ventral and dorsal roots of spinal nerve: 0, separated; 1, united.
> Miyashita *et al*. (2019), Character 9; Miyashita *et al*. (2021), Character 9; Dearden *et al*. (2023), Character 9.

10. Ventral and dorsal roots of spinal nerve originates: 0, intersegmentally; 1, intrasegmentally.
> Miyashita *et al*. (2019), Character ; Miyashita *et al*. (2021), Character ; Dearden *et al*. (2023), Character .

11. Mauthner fibers at rhombomere 4: 0, absent; 1, present.
> Miyashita *et al*. (2019), Character ; Miyashita *et al*. (2021), Character ; Dearden *et al*. (2023), Character .

12. Pineal organ (extra-ocular photoreceptor region expressing pineal opsins): 0, absent; 1, present.
> Miyashita *et al*. (2019), Character ; Miyashita *et al*. (2021), Character ; Dearden *et al*. (2023), Character .

We scored Eriptychius as present based on the pineal opening tentatively identified in the 
median dorsal cartilage. For Sacabambaspis we have followed the interpretation of Gagnier
31, however see Zhang et al. 53 for an alternative anatomical interpretation


13. Pineal opening: 0, covered; 1, uncovered.
> Miyashita *et al*. (2019), Character ; Miyashita *et al*. (2021), Character ; Dearden *et al*. (2023), Character .

We scored Eriptychius as unknown as it is unclear whether the tessera overlying the median 
dorsal plates is in life position or whether it has an opening in. 

14. Adenohypophysis: 0, absent; 1, present.
> Miyashita *et al*. (2019), Character ; Miyashita *et al*. (2021), Character ; Dearden *et al*. (2023), Character .

15. Olfactory peduncles: 0, absent; 1, present.
> Miyashita *et al*. (2019), Character ; Miyashita *et al*. (2021), Character ; Dearden *et al*. (2023), Character .

16. Encapsulated olfactory epithelium with external opening: 0, absent; 1, present.
> Miyashita *et al*. (2019), Character ; Miyashita *et al*. (2021), Character ; Dearden *et al*. (2023), Character .

17. Position of nasohypophyseal/nasal opening: 0, terminal; 1, dorsal.
> Miyashita *et al*. (2019), Character ; Miyashita *et al*. (2021), Character ; Dearden *et al*. (2023), Character .

18. Nasohypophyseal canal: 0, blind; 1, opening into pharynx.
> Miyashita *et al*. (2019), Character ; Miyashita *et al*. (2021), Character ; Dearden *et al*. (2023), Character .

19. Nasohypophyseal opening: 0, single; 1, paired.
> Miyashita *et al*. (2019), Character ; Miyashita *et al*. (2021), Character ; Dearden *et al*. (2023), Character .

Miyashita et al.45,46 coded this character on the basis of the number of olfactory openings. 
Based on Gagnier’s31 interpretation Sacabambaspis had two openings; we have coded it as 
paired. Heterostracan taxa are coded ?: the anatomy nasohypophyseal openings has never 
been conclusively shown.


20. Nasal (olfactory) capsule: 0, unpaired; 1, paired.
> Miyashita *et al*. (2019), Character ; Miyashita *et al*. (2021), Character ; Dearden *et al*. (2023), Character .

21. Nasohypophyseal canal: 0, maintains width and height anteriorly; 1, tapers anteriorly.
> Miyashita *et al*. (2019), Character ; Miyashita *et al*. (2021), Character ; Dearden *et al*. (2023), Character .

22. External opening of nasohypophyseal canal: 0, terminal aperture; 1, tubular extension.
> Miyashita *et al*. (2019), Character ; Miyashita *et al*. (2021), Character ; Dearden *et al*. (2023), Character .

23. Nasohypophyseal barbels extend from: 0, rim of nasohypophyseal aperture; 1, posteriorly to nasohypophyseal aperture.
> Miyashita *et al*. (2019), Character ; Miyashita *et al*. (2021), Character ; Dearden *et al*. (2023), Character .

24. Nasohypophyseal papillae, ventral element: 0, absent; 1, present.
> Miyashita *et al*. (2019), Character ; Miyashita *et al*. (2021), Character ; Dearden *et al*. (2023), Character .

25. Nasohypophyseal papillae, dorsal element(s): 0, midline; 1, paired.
> Miyashita *et al*. (2019), Character ; Miyashita *et al*. (2021), Character ; Dearden *et al*. (2023), Character .

26. Eyes with pigmented retinal epithelium: 0, absent; 1, present.
> Miyashita *et al*. (2019), Character ; Miyashita *et al*. (2021), Character ; Dearden *et al*. (2023), Character .

Eriptychius is assumed to have pigmented eyes on the basis of the orbits and orbital scales 
and so we scored it present.


27. Eyes: 0, exposed; 1, covered by dermis; 2, covered by trunk muscles.
> Miyashita *et al*. (2019), Character ; Miyashita *et al*. (2021), Character ; Dearden *et al*. (2023), Character .

This is unknown in all fossil vertebrates. For consistency’s sake with the other fossil 
vertebrates in the analysis, and as a full reworking of the phylogenetic dataset is beyond the 
scope of this paper, here Eriptychius, Sacabambaspis, Astraspis and heterostracan taxa are 
assumed to have uncovered eyes and we have scored them absent in keeping with the scoring 
approach of Miyashita et al. 45,46
.


28. Extrinsic eye musculature: 0, absent; 1, present.
> Miyashita *et al*. (2019), Character ; Miyashita *et al*. (2021), Character ; Dearden *et al*. (2023), Character .

29. Muscles innervated by oculomotor nerve: 0, three; 1, four.
> Miyashita *et al*. (2019), Character ; Miyashita *et al*. (2021), Character ; Dearden *et al*. (2023), Character .

30. Oblique muscle innervated by trochlear nerve: 0, posterior; 1, superior.
> Miyashita *et al*. (2019), Character ; Miyashita *et al*. (2021), Character ; Dearden *et al*. (2023), Character .

31. Rectus muscles innervated by abducens nerve: 0, two; 1, one.
> Miyashita *et al*. (2019), Character ; Miyashita *et al*. (2021), Character ; Dearden *et al*. (2023), Character .

32. Eyes: 0, laterally placed (interorbital distance equal to width of head at that position); 1, close together near midline (interorbital distance substantially less than width of head at that position); 2, on prominent eyestalk.
> Miyashita *et al*. (2019), Character ; Miyashita *et al*. (2021), Character ; Dearden *et al*. (2023), Character .

Although the eyes are oriented anteriorly rather than laterally Sacabambaspis has been scored 
0 as the eyes are placed laterally relative to the head width at that position. We have scored 
Eriptychius absent based on the inferred position of the orbits and orbital scales.


33. Cartilaginous otic capsules: 0, absent; 1, present.
> Miyashita *et al*. (2019), Character ; Miyashita *et al*. (2021), Character ; Dearden *et al*. (2023), Character .

Cartilaginous otic capsules are not preserved in Eriptychius PF 1795. However, it is unclear 
whether they were present in life as they could have either been unmineralized and thus not 
fossilised, or alternatively lost prior due to disruption to the carcass during fossilisation. Thus 
we have scored this character as unknown. We have also changed the scoring for 
heterostracan taxa from 1 to ?


34. Vertical semicircular canals forming loops that are separate from roof of utriculus: 0, absent; 1, present.
> Miyashita *et al*. (2019), Character ; Miyashita *et al*. (2021), Character ; Dearden *et al*. (2023), Character .

35. Anterior and posterior semicircular canals: 0, share a canal toward utriculus after meeting in a confluence; 1, meet each other to form a single loop.
> Miyashita *et al*. (2019), Character ; Miyashita *et al*. (2021), Character ; Dearden *et al*. (2023), Character .

36. Horizontal semicircular canal: 0, absent; 1, present.
> Miyashita *et al*. (2019), Character ; Miyashita *et al*. (2021), Character ; Dearden *et al*. (2023), Character .

37. Statoliths composed of calcium phosphate: 0, absent; 1, present.
> Miyashita *et al*. (2019), Character ; Miyashita *et al*. (2021), Character ; Dearden *et al*. (2023), Character .

38. Endolymphatic duct: 0, is blind; 1, opens externally.
> Miyashita *et al*. (2019), Character ; Miyashita *et al*. (2021), Character ; Dearden *et al*. (2023), Character .

Based on articulated headshields that have no evidence of an endolymphatic opening we have 
scored both Sacabambaspis and Astraspis as blind (0) for this character. In Eriptychius this is 
unknown. As with the pineal for Sacabambaspis we have followed the interpretation of 
Gagnier31, but see Zhang et al. 53 for an alternative anatomical interpretation

39. Electroreceptive cells: 0, absent; 1, present.
> Miyashita *et al*. (2019), Character ; Miyashita *et al*. (2021), Character ; Dearden *et al*. (2023), Character .

40. Sensory lines: 0, absent; 1, present.
> Miyashita *et al*. (2019), Character ; Miyashita *et al*. (2021), Character ; Dearden *et al*. (2023), Character .

41. Sensory-lines: 0, on head only; 1, on head plus body.
> Miyashita *et al*. (2019), Character ; Miyashita *et al*. (2021), Character ; Dearden *et al*. (2023), Character .

42. Sensory-line: 0, enclosed in grooves; 1, enclosed in canals.
> Miyashita *et al*. (2019), Character ; Miyashita *et al*. (2021), Character ; Dearden *et al*. (2023), Character .

43. Internal taste buds, or functionally equivalent end chemosensory organs innervated by cranial nerves in head: 0, absent; 1, present; 2, lacking internal taste buds but function replaced by Schreiner organs.
> Miyashita *et al*. (2019), Character ; Miyashita *et al*. (2021), Character ; Dearden *et al*. (2023), Character .

44. Branchial apparatus: 0, retains arrangement of pharyngula such that first branchial opening assumes infra- to postotic position; 1, displaced anteriorly; 2, displaced posteriorly.
> Miyashita *et al*. (2019), Character ; Miyashita *et al*. (2021), Character ; Dearden *et al*. (2023), Character .

45. Branchial apparatus, displaced anteriorly such that: 0, first branchial opening assume preotic position; 1, multiple branchial arches occupy preotic position.

46. Branchial apparatus, displaced posteriorly such that prebranchial length is: 0, less than a quarter; 1, approximately quarter; 1, greater than a third of body length.
> Miyashita *et al*. (2019), Character ; Miyashita *et al*. (2021), Character ; Dearden *et al*. (2023), Character .

47. Pharyngeal skeleton: 0, delineates pharyngeal slits with ciliary band; 1, supports well-developed branchial lamellae.
> Miyashita *et al*. (2019), Character ; Miyashita *et al*. (2021), Character ; Dearden *et al*. (2023), Character .

48. Main skeletal support for branchial apparatus with respect to lamellae: 0, lateral; 1, medial.
> Miyashita *et al*. (2019), Character ; Miyashita *et al*. (2021), Character ; Dearden *et al*. (2023), Character .

49. Pharyngeal skeleton: 0, skeletal arches fused with each other; 1, arches isolated (CMC #111; ).
> Miyashita *et al*. (2019), Character ; Miyashita *et al*. (2021), Character ; Dearden *et al*. (2023), Character .

50. Hyomandibular pouch: 0, blind; 1, externally open (spiracle).
> Miyashita *et al*. (2019), Character ; Miyashita *et al*. (2021), Character ; Dearden *et al*. (2023), Character .

51. Respiratory current exits through: 0, atrial space; 1, excurrent duct (=branchial pouch); 2, parabranchial cavity.
> Miyashita *et al*. (2019), Character ; Miyashita *et al*. (2021), Character ; Dearden *et al*. (2023), Character .

52. Single confluent branchial opening: 0, absent; 1, present.
> Miyashita *et al*. (2019), Character ; Miyashita *et al*. (2021), Character ; Dearden *et al*. (2023), Character .

We have changed the scoring for Athenaegis from 0 to ? for this and contingent characters as 
the condition is described as unknown by Soehn and Wilson 56

53. Branchial excurrent duct: 0, opens roughly at position of branchial pouch; 1, extends posteriorly.
> Miyashita *et al*. (2019), Character ; Miyashita *et al*. (2021), Character ; Dearden *et al*. (2023), Character .

54. Branchial openings: 0, spaced accordingly with dimensions of branchial cavities; 1, packed closely together; 2, organized into multiple parallel rows.
> Miyashita *et al*. (2019), Character ; Miyashita *et al*. (2021), Character ; Dearden *et al*. (2023), Character .

This was scored inapplicable for heterostracans with a single confluent branchial opening, 
following the approach for hagfishes with a single branchial opening.

55. Number of arches (or pouches) in branchial apparatus: 0, unconstrained to five; 1, held constant at five.
> Miyashita *et al*. (2019), Character ; Miyashita *et al*. (2021), Character ; Dearden *et al*. (2023), Character .

56. Number of arches (or pouches) in branchial apparatus (unconstrained to five), maximum number: 0, greater than five and fewer than 20; 1, greater than 20.
> Miyashita *et al*. (2019), Character ; Miyashita *et al*. (2021), Character ; Dearden *et al*. (2023), Character .

57. Number of arches (or pouches) in branchial apparatus (unconstrained to five): 0, four or five; 1, six or seven; 2, eight to ten; 3, greater than ten.

62. External branchial openings, demarcated by: 0, single element entirely; 1, single element dorsally; 2, multiple plates; 3, a framework of multiple spines; 4, micromeres; 5, naked (mineralized exoskeleton locally absent around the openings).
> Miyashita *et al*. (2019), Character ; Miyashita *et al*. (2021), Character ; Dearden *et al*. (2023), Character .

63. Position of mouth: 0, terminal; 1, subterminal.
> Miyashita *et al*. (2019), Character ; Miyashita *et al*. (2021), Character ; Dearden *et al*. (2023), Character .

The mouth in Athenaegis is subterminal , although it lacks the elongate rostrum of pteraspid 
heterostracans the oral plates are positioned ventrally relative to the rostral plate Soehn and 
Wilson 56
. Scoring is changed from 0 to 1.

64. Epidermal oral cirri: 0, absent; 1, present.
> Miyashita *et al*. (2019), Character ; Miyashita *et al*. (2021), Character ; Dearden *et al*. (2023), Character .

This is unknowable in most fossil vertebrates. For consistency’s sake with the other fossil 
vertebrates in the analysis, and as a full reworking of the phylogenetic dataset is beyond the 
scope of this paper we have scored Eriptychius, Sacabambaspis, Astraspis, and heterostracan 
taxa absent in keeping with the scoring approach of Miyashita et al. 45,46
.


65. Postoptically derived ectomsenchyme anterior to mandibular arch gives rise to palatal structures that: 0, meet at midline under nasal/nasohypophyseal organs; 1, meet at dorsal midline anterior to nasohypophyseal organs and form a prominent oral roof.
> Miyashita *et al*. (2019), Character ; Miyashita *et al*. (2021), Character ; Dearden *et al*. (2023), Character .

We consider the palate of Sacabambaspis and heterostracans to be insufficiently wellcharacterised to score this character and so have scored them as unknown.

We have scored this present in Eriptychius, following Denison8
, as we consider it the most 
plausible interpretation, but we note that the identity of the endoskeletal tissue is not firmly 
established. Sacabambaspis and Astraspis are scored ? as only dermal elements are preserved 
in fossils: the taphonomic loss of calcified cartilage cannot be ruled out.

Although in previous versions of this matrix they were scored present, oak-leaf shaped 
tubercles are absent in Astraspis 30,33. They are also absent in Eriptychius8
. We have scored 
both taxa absent for this character. At present the only taxon with this character present is 
Sacabambaspis, so the character is uninformative but is kept in to preserve the character 
number scheme

> Miyashita *et al*. (2019), Character 1; Miyashita *et al*. (2021), Character 1; Dearden *et al*. (2023), Character 1.

In previous versions of this matrix (Miyashita et al.45,46) Astraspis is scored as micromeric for 
this character despite the fact that is has a dermal skeleton formed from polyodontode 
tesserae30,33. For the sake of consistency with other scorings we have kept this and scored 
Astraspis and Eriptychius as micromeric, but we note that mesomery is arguably as similar to 
macromery as it is to micromery.

128. Dermal head covering, macromeric: 0, large unpaired plates covering dorsal and ventral sides; 1, covered by tesserae; 2, multiple plates.
> Miyashita *et al*. (2019), Character 1; Miyashita *et al*. (2021), Character 1; Dearden *et al*. (2023), Character 1.
